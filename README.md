### Hi there üëã
I am Nikan Doosti<br>
'Nikan' means genuine and good and it's Persian :iran: originated name, and 'Doosti' literally means friendship!

## About
I am a MSc graduate of computer engineering (artificial intelligence) from Iran University of Science and Technology ([IUST](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en)). <br> I am working as a machine learning engineer on using AI on topics such as Search Engine Optimization (SEO), cache optimization, and content generation! Previously, I did a research assistantship at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) at [AIDAM group](http://aidam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) under supervision of [Vahid Babaei](http://aidam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/?view=people_vahid) in Germany :de:, working on applications of machine learning in fabrication. Prior to that, I was mainly focused on classic computer vision, specifically digital image processing.

- üßê I'm interested in devising self-supervised deep learning models for efficient and accurate modeling, and I always love to work on interdisciplinary topics such as intersection of AI and Science.
- üå± I'm currently (re)learning C++ and started learning MLOps.
- üëØ I'm looking to collaborate on PyTorch framework. Meet me on official PyTorch forum: [PyTorch Discuss](https://discuss.pytorch.org/u/nikronic/summary). Fun fact: I attempted Tensorflow 4 times, never got to stick to it, tried PyTorch once, fell in love!
- üíì I'd love to play games, particularly video games. I mostly play Dota 2, CnC Generals ZH. I am noob in the execution (slow body, eyes, FPS, and refresh reate :D), but I plan well!
- üí¨ Ask me about anything, but I don't know how much I don't know. However, I know a bit about machine learning, computational manufacturing, and compuer vision.
- üì´ How to reach me: My email `nikan [dot] doosti [at] outlook [dot] com`
- ‚≠ê Giving stars to people's projects not only won't consume yours, it will further encourage the developers!

I follow Github timeline almost everyday (Works as a social media for me :D).
