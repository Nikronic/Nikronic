### Hi there 👋
I am Nikan Doosti Lakhani<br>
'Nikan' means genuine and good and it's Persian :iran: originated name, 'Doosti' literally means friendship and 'Lakhani' is a place where my paternal family comes from. 

## About
I am a MSc graduate of computer engineering (artificial intelligence) from Iran University of Science and Technology. <br>
Also, I was an computational manufacturing research assistant at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) at [AIDAM group](http://aidam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) under supervision of [Vahid Babaei](http://aidam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/?view=people_vahid) in Germany :de:, working on applications of machine learning in fabrication.<br> Our work which was my first ever academic paper has been [published (@SCF)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3485114.3485124)!<br>

- 🧐 I'm interested in devising self-supervised deep learning models for visual computing and computer graphics and I always love to work on interdisciplinary topics such as intersection of AI and Science.
- 🌱 I'm currently (re)learning C++ and started learning MLOps.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on PyTorch framework. Meet me on official PyTorch forum: [PyTorch Discuss](https://discuss.pytorch.org/u/nikronic/summary).
- 💓 I'd love to play games, particularly video games.
- 💬 Ask me about anything, although most of the time my answers will be "I don't know! tell me about it." but I know a little about computer vision, computational manufacturing and deep learning.
- 📫 How to reach me: My email `nikan [dot] doosti [at] outlook [dot] com`
- ⭐ Giving stars to people's projects not only won't consume yours, it will further encourage the developers!

I follow Github timeline almost everyday (Works as a social media for me :D).
