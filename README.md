### Hi there 👋
I am Nikan Doosti<br>
'Nikan' means genuine and good and it's Persian originated name, and 'Doosti' literally means friendship!

## About
I am a master's graduate of Computer Engineering (Artificial Intelligence) from Iran University of Science and Technology ([IUST](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en)) one of the most prestigious universities in Iran. <br> In my work, I utilize Artificial Intelligence to provide data-driven decision making for different services. Previously, I did a research internship at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) at [AIDAM group](http://aidam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) in Germany :de:, working on applications of machine learning in fabrication. Prior to that, I was mainly focused on classic computer vision, specifically digital image processing.

- 🧐 I'm interested in machine learning, deep learning, physical simulation, and I always love to work on interdisciplinary topics such as intersection of AI and Science/Engineering.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on PyTorch framework. Meet me on official PyTorch forum: [PyTorch Discuss](https://discuss.pytorch.org/u/nikronic/summary)
- 💓 I'd love to play games, particularly video games. I mostly play Dota 2 and CnC Generals ZH. I am noob in execution (slow body, eyes, FPS, and refresh rate :D), but I plan well!
- 💬 Ask me about anything, but I don't know how much I don't know. However, I know a bit about AI and Computer Graphics/Vision.
- 📫 How to reach me: My email `nikan [dot] doosti [at] outlook [dot] com` (more details on the bottom of home page of my website)
- ⭐ Giving stars is a small gesture, but it means a lot! So give stars to cool projects.

I follow Github timeline almost everyday (Works as a social media for me :D).
