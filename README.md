### Hi there 👋
I am Mohammad (Nikan) Doosti Lakhani

## About
I am pursuing the master of computer engineering focusing on computer vision at Iran University of Science and Technology (unfortunately!). Most imprtantly, I am an computational manufacturing/visual computing intern at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](mpi-inf.mpg.de) in Saarland, working on representing 3D objects. I tweet about science, mostly computer vision and image processing and I spend my spare time, playing FPS and strategic games such as Factorio. I love to learn about cultures that's why I stick to the stand up comedy.

Note: I use Github for open source contribution and another platform for work. I may not have commits for a long period, but I always watch Github timeline (everyday).

- 🔭 I'm currently working on my master's thesis about 3D scene representation.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning English and Factorio game!
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on PyTorch framework. Meet me on official PyTorch forum: [PyTorch Discuss](https://discuss.pytorch.org/u/nikronic/summary)
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with anything!
- 🎶 I'd love to learn violin to understand godess of it; Lindsey Stirling
- 💓 I'd love to play games, either video or physical.
- 💬 Ask me about anything, although %99.99~ of my answers will be "I don't know! tell me about it." but I know a little about computer vision.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NIkronic), My email on my [CV website](https://nikronic.github.io)
- ⚡ Fun fact: If I could select me in another parallel universe, I would choose the one who is gamer/streamer.
- ⭐ Giving stars to people's projects not only will not consume yours, it will encourage developers to work harder and better.
