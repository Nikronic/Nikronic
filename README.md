### Hi there 👋
I am Nikan Doosti Lakhani<br>
'Nikan' means genuine and good and it's Persian :iran: originated name, 'Doosti' literally means friendship and 'Lakhani' is a place where my paternal family comes from. 

## About
I am pursuing the master of computer engineering focusing on aritifical intelligence at IUST (unfortunately! PS: It has a long and complicated story and I think if you do not know what I mean, you should ask since it might be important.). <br>
Also, I was an computational manufacturing/visual computing research assistant at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) at [CAM group](http://cam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) under supervision of [Dr. Vahid Babaei](http://cam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/?view=people_vahid) in Saarland :de:, working on deep learning in applications of Physics.<br> Our work which was my first ever academic paper has been accepted and will be published soon!<br>

I tweet about science, mostly deep learning and I spend my spare time, playing FPS and strategic games such as Factorio. I love to learn about cultures and watching stand up comedy.<br>

You can find me everywhere with username _**Nikronic**_!

Note: I use Github for open source contribution and another platform for work. I may not have commits for a long period, but I always follow Github timeline (almost everyday).

- 🔭 I'm currently working on my master's thesis about Physics Informed Deep Learning.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning C++!
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on PyTorch framework. Meet me on official PyTorch forum: [PyTorch Discuss](https://discuss.pytorch.org/u/nikronic/summary)
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with finding an appropriate PhD position! Currently, my biggest dilema is that do I want to be a researcher or not. I would love to hear about your experiences!
- 🎶 I'd love to learn violin; Lindsey Stirling sparked the idea.
- 💓 I'd love to play games, specifically video games.
- 💬 Ask me about anything, although most of the time my answers will be "I don't know! tell me about it." but I know a little about computer vision, computational manufacturing and deep learning.
- 📫 How to reach me: My email on my [CV website](https://nikronic.github.io)
- ⚡ Fun fact: If I could select me in another parallel universe, I would choose the one who is gamer/streamer.
- ⭐ Giving stars to people's projects not only will not consume yours, it will encourage developers to work harder and better.
