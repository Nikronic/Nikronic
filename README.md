### Hi there 👋
I am Mohammad (Nikan) Doosti Lakhani<br>
Mohammad is name my parents gave me, but I've chosen(!) Nikan and after years of struggle, now people call me Nik (abbreviated). It means genuine and good and it's Persian :iran: originated name.

## About
I am pursuing the master of computer engineering focusing on aritifical inteliigence at IUST (unfortunately! PS: It has a long and complicated story and I think if you do not know what I mean, you should ask since it is really important.). <br>
Also, I am an computational manufacturing/visual computing intern at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) at [CAM group](http://cam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) under supervision of [Dr. Vahid Babaei](http://cam.mpi-inf.mpg.de/?view=people_vahid) in Saarland :de:, working on deep learning in applications of Physics.<br>

I tweet about science, mostly deep learning and I spend my spare time, playing FPS and strategic games such as Factorio. I love to learn about cultures that's why I stick to the stand up comedy (the only scene that has not been destroyed completely by language/thought control rules!).<br>

You can find me everywhere with username _**Nikronic**_ except Instagram for obvious reasons!

Note: I use Github for open source contribution and another platform for work. I may not have commits for a long period, but I always follow Github timeline (almost everyday).

- 🔭 I'm currently working on my master's thesis about Physics Informed Deep Learning.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning C++ and Factorio game!
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on PyTorch framework. Meet me on official PyTorch forum: [PyTorch Discuss](https://discuss.pytorch.org/u/nikronic/summary)
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with anything! Currently, my biggest dilema is that do I want to be a researcher or not. I would love to hear about your experiences!
- 🎶 I'd love to learn violin; Lindsey Stirling is the motivation.
- 💓 I'd love to play games, specifically video games.
- 💬 Ask me about anything, although most of the time my answers will be "I don't know! tell me about it." but I know a little about computer vision and deep learning based manufacturing.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NIkronic), My email on my [CV website](https://nikronic.github.io)
- ⚡ Fun fact: If I could select me in another parallel universe, I would choose the one who is gamer/streamer.
- ⭐ Giving stars to people's projects not only will not consume yours, it will encourage developers to work harder and better.
